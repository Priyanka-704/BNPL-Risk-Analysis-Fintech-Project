# BNPL Risk Analysis Fintech Project

## Overview
A beginner-level Fintech project building a risk assessment tool for Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) services like Klarna or Afterpay. Using Python and SQL, we'll analyze mock transaction data to predict defaults, detect fraud patterns, and generate insights/dashboards. Goal: Simulate real-world risk mitigation for sustainable lending, focusing on credit scoring, fraud flags, and compliance.

**Key Features**:
- SQL database for BNPL loans and user profiles (e.g., transaction history, statuses).
- Python-based risk scoring (rule-based + intro ML with Scikit-learn).
- Interactive Plotly dashboard for visualizations (e.g., risk heatmaps, default trends).
- Business report on mitigation strategies (e.g., loan limits for high-risk users).

**Skills Demonstrated**:
- SQL querying and data prep (SQLite).
- Python data analysis (Pandas/NumPy), basic ML, and visualization (Plotly).
- Fintech business acumen: Analyzing risks like over-indebtedness and fraud.

## Tech Stack (All Free & Beginner-Friendly)
- **Environment**: Google Colab or Anaconda/Jupyter.
- **Languages/Libraries**: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Plotly), SQL (SQLite).
- **Data Sources**: Mock data + Kaggle "Credit Risk" datasets.
- **Version Control**: GitHub.
- **Optional**: Pandas-datareader for economic APIs (e.g., unemployment rates affecting defaults).

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/Priyanka-704/BNPL-Risk-Analysis-Fintech-Project.git` (or download ZIP).
2. Open in Google Colab: Upload the .ipynb files or copy code into a new notebook.
3. Install libraries: Run `!pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn plotly sqlite3 pandas-datareader` in the first cell.
4. Run notebooks sequentially (e.g., start with Day0_Setup_BNPL_Project.ipynb).
5. For local setup: Use Anaconda > Jupyter Notebook.

## Project Timeline (25 Days)
- **Phase 1 (Days 1-5)**: Research & Planning (BNPL risks, SQL schema, datasets).
- **Phase 2 (Days 6-10)**: Data Setup & Prep (ETL pipeline, cleaning, queries).
- **Phase 3 (Days 11-15)**: Risk Modeling & Analysis (scoring, stats, visuals).
- **Phase 4 (Days 16-20)**: Dashboard & Simulation (Plotly/Dash app, what-if scenarios).
- **Phase 5 (Days 21-25)**: Wrap-Up & Portfolio (docs, testing, report/deck).

## Day 0 Progress
- Repository created on 25 September 2025.
- Environment set up in Google Colab with libraries tested.
- Mock BNPL data created (5 sample loans), inserted into SQLite, and queried for risks (e.g., 20% default rate).
- Basic risk flags added (e.g., 'High Risk' for defaults).
- Notebook: Day0_Setup_BNPL_Project.ipynb (includes code and outputs).

## Next Steps
- Day 1: Research BNPL basics and risks.
- Contributions: Open to feedback! Built by Priyanka as a skill-building project for Fintech analyst roles.
