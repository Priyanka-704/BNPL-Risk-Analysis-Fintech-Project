# BNPL Risk Analysis Fintech Project

## Overview
A beginner-level Fintech project building a risk assessment tool for Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) services like Klarna or Afterpay. Using Python and SQL, we'll analyze mock transaction data to predict defaults, detect fraud patterns, and generate insights/dashboards. Goal: Simulate real-world risk mitigation for sustainable lending, focusing on credit scoring, fraud flags, and compliance.

**Key Features**:
- SQL database for BNPL loans and user profiles (e.g., transaction history, statuses).
- Python-based risk scoring (rule-based + intro ML with Scikit-learn).
- Interactive Plotly dashboard for visualizations (e.g., risk heatmaps, default trends).
- Business report on mitigation strategies (e.g., loan limits for high-risk users).

**Skills Demonstrated**:
- SQL querying and data prep (SQLite).
- Python data analysis (Pandas/NumPy), basic ML, and visualization (Plotly).
- Fintech business acumen: Analyzing risks like over-indebtedness and fraud.

## Tech Stack (All Free & Beginner-Friendly)
- **Environment**: Google Colab or Anaconda/Jupyter.
- **Languages/Libraries**: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Plotly), SQL (SQLite).
- **Data Sources**: Mock data + Kaggle "Credit Risk" datasets.
- **Version Control**: GitHub.
- **Optional**: Pandas-datareader for economic APIs (e.g., unemployment rates affecting defaults).
